[5 CSS Practices To Avoid as a Web Developer](https://betterprogramming.pub/5-css-practices-to-avoid-as-a-web-developer-1b7553c05131)

1. Set Margins or Padding and Then Reset Them
2. Add display: block for Elements With position: absolute or position: fixed
3. Use transform: translate (-50%, -50%) To Center
4. Use width: 100% for Block Elements
5. Set display: block for Flex Items

Indeed, some of these practices are used in my projects. But when I look deeper, I see that the root cause is my deficient knowledge of CSS. For example, I didn't know the specific usage of `:nth-child`, what a shame!

### Words

* crutches：拐杖，walking with a crutches
* concise：简洁的，brief
* adjacent：two things are next to each other
* arbitrary：蛮横的，武断的，using unlimited personal power without considering other people's rights or wishes
